The goal of this collection of assignment is to help you review (i) The Big-Oh method for time 
complexity analysis; (ii) Recursion Algorithms 
 
Notes: In this assignment, we use ‘n’ to denote the size of the input data 
 
1. The big-Oh method can be used to analyze the time complexity of an algorithm. Of the 
following statements, which one (s) is (are) incorrect (MARK ALL)?  (2 points) 
 
A.  The big-Oh method is used to count the exact amount of operations needed to complete an 
algorithm.  
 
B.  Let d(n) denote the number of operations needed for an algorithm.  If d(n) is O(f (n)), then 
a*d(n) is O (f (n)) as well where a is a positive constant.  
 
C. If the number of operations executed by two algorithms A and B are 10*n and 2*n2, 
respectively, B is a better algorithm since it would need less operations while dealing with n=4 
samples.  
 
D. If an algorithm needs a total of  (2*n2+3*n+1) operations, its time complexity of this 
algorithm is O(n2).  
 
E. If an algorithm needs a total of  100*n2+20*n3+2n operations, its time complexity is O(2n).  
  
 
2. Consider seven algorithms which need the following number of operations, respectively:  
(a)10*n*log(n) 
(b) n10 
(c) 10n 
(d) 102 
(d) 5*n+8*n2 
(e) 4*n 
(f) n3 
 
 Please order these algorithms (from low to high) according to their time complexity.  (2 points) 
 
 
3. Please design and implement a non-recursion function to find the minimal number and 
maximal number in an unsorted sequence, e.g., [10, 39, 47, 1, 49,100]. Please provide at least 
two DIFFERENT solutions (not using recursion) and analyze their time complexities using the 
BIG-OH method.  (Don’t use third-party libraries/functions。 Include your codes of these two 
solutions and their testing codes in the .py file to submit. (2 points) 
 
  
 
4.  Please design and implement a recursive function to find the minimal number and maximal 
number in an unsorted sequence, e.g., [10, 39, 47, 1, 49,100].  In your write-up, please describe 
the algorithm design:  
• what’re the function arguments and return values?  
• how to deal with terminal conidiations, and  
• how to recur 
Please analyze the time complexity of your recursive method, and compare it to your solutions in 
Question 3.  Include this function and its testing codes in the .py file to submit. (2 points) 
 
5.  Please design and implement an recursive function to reverse a string. If the input is 
‘SDSU@San’, the output is ‘naS@USDS’.  In your write-up, please describe the algorithm 
design:  
• what’re the function arguments and return values?  
• how to deal with terminal conidiations, and  
• how to recur 
Please analyze the time complexity of this recursive function using the big-Oh method. Include 
this function and its testing codes in the .py file to submit.  (2 points)
